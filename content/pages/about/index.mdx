## Hi! I'm Albertus! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer who grew up in a small town in Indonesia 🇮🇩.

I studied Computer Science at University of Indonesia for 4 years as an undergrad and will be graduating soon 🏫.

Throughout my 4 years of studies there, I've had the privilege to intern as a software engineer in [Google](github.com/google), [Gojek](github.com/gojek), and [Traveloka](github.com/traveloka).

At [Google](github.com/google), I joined [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) team and created a new feature called [Layout Explorer](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/devtools/inspector#flutter-layout-explorer)
that helps people to understand Flex Layout in Flutter. My internship at Google was like a dream come true. It was truly a life-changing experience since it was my first time traveling to the United States and
living in Seattle for 3 months! For someone who grew up in a small town like me, I was really happy to be able to join Google after several interviewing attempts (~15 applications, ~2 interview rejections).
Never in my life, I would imagine that an Indonesian and "rural boy" like me could join Google!

After [Google](github.com/google), I was supposed to join and intern at [Facebook](github.com/facebook) in their London office during the next summer (Jun - Aug '20).
But unfortunately, because of the pandemic, my internship was cancelled.

After that, instead of doing nothing for the whole summer amid the world pandemic situation, I decided to spend my summer remote interning at a very-early-stage & local startup called [Jago Coffee](https://jagocoffee.com),
tinkering around with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) at production use, while doing interview preparation for a new grad software engineering role.

I'm glad to share that amid the COVID-19 situation I was still able to secure an offer from my dream company, [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com), to help build the online payments infrastructure for APAC region.

My first exposure with programming was through competitive programming when I was still at high school, trying to compete in the Indonesian National Olympiad of Informatics,
but failed miserably at provincial level 😂. Since then, my interest with the tech world grows and I decided to major in Computer Science.

I'm currently in love and obsessed with building great products and I love stitching different parts of software components.
I'm excited to start my very first full-time job soon in hope to learn about how to build a great product and grow personally as a software engineer.

I'm a huge nerd and I love playing JRPG video games and watching anime during my leisure ⚽
Also, I like to speed type and I can type around 150-160 word per minute on average. Hit me up on [TypeRacer](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=adalberht) ⭐

## What I'm doing now

After graduating, I'm joining [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com) as a New Grad Software Engineer to build the online payments infrastructure for APAC region and will be based on their Singapore office!

Stripe is one of my dream companies and I always heard cool stuffs and good things from people on the internet about the product and the people working at Stripe.

Personally, I think it's a great time to join [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com). I also believe and very excited about what [Raylene Yung said here](https://firstround.com/review/the-engineers-guide-to-career-growth-advice-from-my-time-at-stripe-and-facebook/):

> “Personal growth is compounded by company growth.“

I'm excited to join Stripe and looking forward to share all my learnings as a new grad/junior software engineer who is lucky enough to get the privilege to work with the most brilliants in the industry :)
